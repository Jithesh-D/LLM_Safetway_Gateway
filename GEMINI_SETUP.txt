// Configuration & Usage Summary

## What Was Changed

Your LLM Gateway now generates dynamic responses using **Google's Generative AI (Gemini)** instead of hardcoded answers!

## Quick Start

1. Run `npm install` (if not already done) to install the dotenv package
2. Run `npm run server` to start the backend
3. When you submit a **SAFE** prompt, it will now generate a response using Gemini API

## Files You Need To Know About

### gemini-service.js (NEW)
- Handles all communication with Google's Gemini API
- Manages timeouts, errors, and retries
- Returns generated responses or error messages

### answer.js (UPDATED)
- Now calls Gemini API instead of using hardcoded answers
- Returns promises that resolve to AI-generated text

### server.js (UPDATED)
- Loads environment variables with dotenv
- Passes safe prompts to Gemini for response generation
- Falls back to Ollama if Gemini fails

### .env (UPDATED)
- Contains: GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyCYyfqpCWN0TTvK5KotT3nBZy5HDIacKU0

### GEMINI_INTEGRATION.md (NEW)
- Complete documentation on setup and troubleshooting

## API Key Details

Your API Key: `AIzaSyCYyfqpCWN0TTvK5KotT3nBZy5HDIacKU0`

This is already configured in `.env` file.

## How It Works

```
User Input
    ↓
Safety Analysis (RITD/NCD/LDF)
    ↓
Is it SAFE?
    ├─→ YES → Gemini API generates response → Display
    └─→ NO  → Block and show warning
```

## Testing

Try submitting these safe prompts:
- "What is machine learning?"
- "Explain quantum physics"
- "How does photosynthesis work?"
- "Write a poem about space"

You should see AI-generated responses instead of the old hardcoded ones!

## Important Notes

✅ API key is set in .env file (already done)
✅ dotenv package needed (add to your npm install)
✅ Fallback to Ollama works if Gemini fails
✅ All responses are generated in real-time
✅ 30-second timeout prevents hanging requests

## Next Steps

1. Run: `npm install` 
2. Run: `npm run server`
3. Open browser and test with safe prompts
4. Check console logs to see Gemini API calls happening
